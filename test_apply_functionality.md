# Test Apply Now Functionality

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. ✅ Apply Now Button is Now Functional
- The "Apply Now" button now creates actual applications in the database
- Prevents duplicate applications (shows alert if already applied)
- Shows success/error messages
- Refreshes the applications list after successful application

### 2. ✅ Real Match Scoring Algorithm
Implemented the exact formula you requested:
- **Skill Fit (40%)**: Matches student skills with internship requirements
- **Location Fit (20%)**: Prioritizes internships in same city/district/state
- **Affirmative Action Weight (20%)**: Bonus for special categories (SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwD)
- **Participation History (10%)**: Bonus for returning participants
- **Randomization/Exploration (10%)**: Adds variety to prevent identical scores

### 3. ✅ Local First Filtering Works
- When "Local First" is toggled ON, it filters internships by:
  - Same city (highest priority)
  - Same district (medium priority) 
  - Same state (lowest priority)
- When toggled OFF, shows all internships regardless of location
- Works with any student location (Gujarat/Surat example or any other location)

## How to Test

1. **Apply Now Button**:
   - Click "Apply Now" on any internship
   - Should see "Application submitted successfully!" message
   - Check "Recent Applications" tab to see the new application
   - Try applying to the same internship again - should show "already applied" message

2. **Match Scoring**:
   - Match percentages should now show realistic scores (like 35% match)
   - Scores are calculated based on the 5-factor formula
   - Different students will see different match scores based on their profile

3. **Local First Toggle**:
   - Toggle "Local First" ON - should only show internships in your region
   - Toggle "Local First" OFF - should show all internships
   - Works with any student location (Surat, Mumbai, Delhi, etc.)

## Database Changes
- Added all necessary fields to profiles and internships tables
- Created proper indexes for performance
- Applications are stored in the applications table with proper relationships

## No Other Functionality Changed
- All existing features remain intact
- Only the Apply Now button, match scoring, and Local First filtering were modified
- UI and other functionality remain exactly the same
